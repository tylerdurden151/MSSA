/*You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 
 * If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1: a b c
word2: p q r
merged: a p b q c r

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1: a b
word2: p q r s
merged: a p b q r s
